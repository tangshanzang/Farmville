This is my school project for basic java, aiming for grade VG

Thoughts:

This is my first project, code can be confusing, need to work with clean code skill in the future.

Some things can be made as method to avoid duplicate coding.

Gained experience on detecting and dealing with error, for example serializing a class with Scanner would
cause deserializing to fail, transient helped me solve the problem. 

Debug can be a tough task.

Discuss and communicate problems/errors with classmates or other people that can code is very important, sometimes
the cause of the problem was obvious but it became the blind spot for me or for my classmates.

Print out variables/booleans/class when trying to detect the cause of problem is very useful!!
